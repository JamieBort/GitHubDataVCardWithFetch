**Activity: GitHub Slim VCard - Pair Programming**

In this activity, you'll work with a partner to recreate the GitHub Data VCard assignment from last night.

Pick one of your projects and replace the XMLHttpRequest with the fetch API.

**Bonus**

If you have some extra time, continue playing with the [GitHub API}(https://developer.github.com/v3/) and see what other endpoints you can access without authentication.
