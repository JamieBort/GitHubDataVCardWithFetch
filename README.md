# Activity: GitHub Slim VCard - Pair Programming

In this activity, you'll work with a partner to recreate the [GitHub Data VCard](https://github.com/JamieBort/GitHubDataVCard) assignment from last night.

Pick one of your projects and replace the XMLHttpRequest with the fetch API.

## Bonus

If you have some extra time, continue playing with the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and see what other endpoints you can access without authentication.


## Comment
Not finished. I want to come back to this to play with the api some more. Also, the styles need to be changed before deleting the 'old' directory.
